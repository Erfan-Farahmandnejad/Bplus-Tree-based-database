# B+ Tree Database Management System

---

## **üìñ Subject: Overview**
This project implements a **B+ Tree-based database management system (DBMS)** to simulate real-world database operations such as indexing, searching, adding, and deleting records efficiently. By leveraging the **B+ Tree** data structure, the project optimizes these operations, showcasing the power of advanced indexing mechanisms in modern database systems.

The project also includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **JavaFX**, providing an intuitive and user-friendly way to interact with the database.

---

## **üéØ Objectives**
- Master the **B+ Tree data structure**, including its **self-balancing** and indexing features.
- Simulate core **database functionalities**, including table creation and index management.
- Enhance familiarity with database systems and concepts.
- Develop a practical understanding of **data organization** and efficient querying.

## **üöÄ Features**

### **1. Core Features**
1. **B+ Tree Implementation**:
   - Complete implementation of the B+ Tree with **index nodes** and **leaf nodes**.
   - Efficient **insert**, **search**, and **delete** operations.
   - Self-balancing mechanisms to maintain optimal performance.

2. **Table Management**:
   - Create tables with custom attributes (e.g., column names and data types).
   - Add, update, and delete records in tables.

3. **Indexing**:
   - Use B+ Trees to build and manage indices for optimized searches.
   - Support for primary, unique, and non-unique indexes.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - Advanced query capabilities, leveraging B+ Tree indexing for **range-based** and **point-based queries**.

5. **Graphical User Interface**:
   - Developed with **JavaFX**, featuring:
     - **Table Management View**: Easily create and modify tables.
     - **Query View**: Execute queries with clear visual feedback.
   - Styled with custom CSS for a professional look and feel.
